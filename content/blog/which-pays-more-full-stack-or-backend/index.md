When thinking about starting a career in software development many people wonder which pays more, is it full-stack or backend development that pays more? To find out, let's take a look at what each job involves, the skills needed, and their salaries.

## **What is Full-Stack Development?**

Full stack development refers to the full process of producing application software, which consists of both the front and back ends. The front end is what you see and interact with which is similar to the buttons and style of a website. At the same time, the backend manages the logic and operations that allow the program to function.

### **Who is a Full-Stack Developer?**

A full-stack developer is best described as a "jack of all trades." They are knowledgeable about both the visible aspects of a website or app (front end) and the behind-the-scenes parts (back end). They are also familiar with the variety of tools and technologies to build and manage a whole application.

### **What are the Responsibilities of a Full-Stack Developer**

- Creating and building the parts of a website or app that people see and interact with.

- Effective collaboration with other developers
- Building and regularly managing the database
- Creating robust testing for Web Apps
- Ensuring the app runs smoothly from what users see to the backend functions.

### **What Are the Skills Required for a Full Stack Developer?**

## **Backend Developer**

## **Salary Comparison**

Senior full-stack developers receive better pay than senior back-end developers. The reason why companies are prepared to pay extra for senior full-stack engineers is mainly because it is more efficient to hire one individual who can do both front-end and back-end work rather than hiring two persons for each position.

However, backend developers often earn a bit more than full-stack developers because their work is specialized and crucial for application functionality. Also, full-stack developers, who can manage both front-end and back-end tasks, are also highly valued and can earn competitive salaries.

## **Conclusion**

Choosing between full stack and backend development should depend on what you like and what you're good at. But if you enjoy working on both the visual and technical aspects of applications, full-stack development might be the best for you. And if you prefer focusing on the server-side logic and managing databases, backend development could be a better fit for you. Both career paths are rewarding and offer many opportunities for growth.
